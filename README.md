#Reflection 
Adding a single enemy to travel along the path was simple but adding more made it way harder and not easy to underdstand 

adding multiple towers using inheritance made making the towers a lot easier 

its really fun to add music to your game

some youtube videos may not be as helpful as others is something ive learned a lot about during this project

overall the creative part of making this game was fun and the coding part was harder but a lot of fun to figrue out
